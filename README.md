### Use Computer Vision techniques via OpenCV to identify lane lines for a self-driving car.

### Train Convolutional Neural Networks to identify between various traffic signs.

### Train Deep Neural Networks to fit complex datasets and with Keras, a power Neural Network

### Build and train a fully functional self driving car to drive on its own!

### Used Udacity's Open source Self Driving car silulator to simulate a fully functional self-driving car by training on one track and validating / testing on other unknown track
