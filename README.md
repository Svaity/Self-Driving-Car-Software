Self-driving cars, have rapidly become one of the most transformative technologies to emerge. Fuelled by Deep Learning algorithms, they are continuously driving our society forward, and creating new opportunities in the mobility sector.
This is a fully functional self-driving car fuelled entirely by Deep Learning. This powerful simulation  built using hands on skills in neural networks which could be brought bring to any project or company.

## How to setup:

- You should clone the repo first.
- Open the terminal and cd into /Self-Driving-Car-Software
- Run the environment using

    Source activate environment

- Install the dependencies:

    pip install [name of the dependency]

    Dependencies: keras, matplotlib, sklearn, imgaug, pandas, ntpath, numpy

- Run the project

    python drive.py

## Summary

- Used Computer Vision techniques via OpenCV to identify lane lines for a self-driving car.
- Trained Convolutional Neural Networks to identify between various traffic signs.
- Trained Deep Neural Networks to fit complex datasets and with Keras, a power Neural Network
- Built and trained a fully functional self driving car to drive on its own!
- Used Udacity's Open source Self Driving car silulator to simulate a fully functional self-driving car by training on one track and validating / testing on other unknown track
